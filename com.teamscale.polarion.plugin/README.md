## Assumptions and Design Decisions

## Code formatting

We are following the Java coding style guidelines from Google.

And we use [this opensource tool](https://github.com/google/google-java-format) from Google locally in the dev IDE.

Also, we set up [this GitHub action](https://github.com/axel-op/googlejavaformat-action) to auto format the pushed code if need.
